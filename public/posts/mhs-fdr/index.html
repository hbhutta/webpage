      <h1>Multiple Hypothesis Testing and the False Discovery Rate</h1>

<h1 id="background-and-motivation">Background and motivation</h1>
<h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>A <em>hypothesis</em> is a guess. In any (statistical) hypothesis test, we have a null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) and an <em>alternative</em> hypothesis ($H_{a}$). The latter is named as such because it is the <em>alternative</em> guess, opposite of $H_{0}$. We decide to accept or reject $H_{0}$ based on a quantity called the <a href="#p-value">${p}$-value</a>, derived from the <strong>test statistic</strong> which itself is obtained from the <strong>statistical test</strong> we choose to use considering our data.</p>
<h2 id="p-value-and-the-significance-level-alpha">$p$-value and the significance level $\alpha$</h2>
<p>The $p$-value is the likelihood of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis $H_{0}$. It was decided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that having $p &lt; 0.05$ means there is less than a $5\%$ chance of falsely rejecting $H_0$ so it is safe to do so, and having $p &gt; 0.05$ means there is more than a $5\%$ chance of falsely rejecting $H_{0}$ so it is <em>not</em> safe to do so. In other words, $5\%$ is the threshold for determining if the likelihood of falsely rejecting $H_{0}$ is trivial or non-trivial.</p>
<p>I do not prefer the phrasing that &ldquo;the smaller the $p$-value, the stronger the evidence against $H_{0}$&rdquo; as it is sometimes described in courses, especially with the use of the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;, since the $p$-value is not a measure of certainty but a measure of likelihood.</p>
<p>The significance level $\alpha$ is the likelihood of falsely rejecting the $H_{0}$ which I, as the experimental investigator, decide on. This $\alpha$ is the threshold we use in determining if the likelihood of rejecting $H_{0}$ that we have obtained is trivial or non-trivial.</p>
<h2 id="type-i-t1-and-type-ii-t2-error">Type I (T1) and Type II (T2) Error</h2>
<p>An error is a mistake. T1 and T2 errors are mistakes. In clinical trials, sometimes we accidentally make mistakes. It&rsquo;s important to know the proportion of our claims that are mistakes, and to minimize this proportion &ndash; if not completely eliminate it.</p>
<p>A T1 error occurs when we falsely reject $H_{0}$:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <em>false acceptance</em> of the altnernative hypothesis $H_{a}$ &ndash; hence <strong>a T1 error is a false positive</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A T2 error occurs when</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <em>false rejection</em> of the</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose we are conducting an RNA-seq experiment with the following null and alternative hypotheses:
$$
\begin{cases}
H_{0}: \text{The mean gene expression of gene $g$ is the same in treatments $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$} \\
H_{a}: \text{The mean gene expression of gene $g$ is different in treatments $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$}
\end{cases}
$$
In this example, a false positive (T1 error) would be accepting (affirming) $H_{a}$ when $H_{0}$ is (very likely to be) true
(as indicated by the $p$-value), and a false negative (T2 error) would be rejecting (not affirming) $H_{a}$ when</p>
<p>Bonferroni error rate correction (type 1 error rate control)</p>
<h2 id="mutliple-hypothesis-testing-and-the-multiple-comparisons-problem">Mutliple Hypothesis Testing and the Multiple Comparisons Problem</h2>
<p>In differential gene expression analysis, we want to know if a given gene $g$ has different mean expression levels in different treatments (groups). Comparing means makes this a statistical question. Supposing we have gene $g$ and treatments $T_{1}, \ldots, T_{k}$, and supposing that the mean expression level (however this is measured) of gene $g$ in treatment $T_{i}$ is denoted as $\mu_{g, T_{i}}$, we have the following null and alternative hypotheses <em>for each gene</em> $g$:
$$
\begin{cases}
H_{0}: \forall 1 \leq i \neq j \leq k, \mu_{g, T_{i}}  =    \mu_{g, T_{j}} \\
H_{a}: \exists i,j \in [1, \ldots, k]: \mu_{g, T_{i}}  \neq \mu_{g, T_{j}}
\end{cases}
$$
In the null hypothesis $H_{0}$, we hypothesize that any two treatments $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$ have the same mean expression level of gene $g$. In the alternative hypothesis $H_{a}$, we hypothesize that there exist at least two treatments $T_{i}$ and $T_{j}$ with <em>different</em> mean expression levels of gene $g$.</p>
<p>We will have this set of hypotheses <em>for each gene</em>, hence the situation becomes <em>multiple hypothesis testing</em>.</p>
